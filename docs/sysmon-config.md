# Sysmon Configuration
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

## Goals
- Install Sysmon on endpoints
- Use a tuned config to capture high-value events

## Implementation notes to add
- Sysmon version used
- Config source (e.g., SwiftOnSecurity / custom)
- Key Event IDs enabled (e.g., 1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 22)

## Evidence to add
- Screenshot: Sysmon installed
- Screenshot: Example Sysmon event on endpoint
- Config file reference (sanitized): /configs/sysmonconfig.xml
